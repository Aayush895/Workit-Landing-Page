## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned how to create curvaceous websites using the `clip-path` property in css. 


### Continued development

In the future I want to become more proficient in using the `clip-path` property so that I can build complex landing pages that involve creating complex shapes.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/basic-shape/ellipse) - This document helped me in able to identify the shape that will be required to achieve the desired output and it also helped me in using the `ellipse` shape from the `clip-path` property.
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY7Rj8aZcZk) - This video hepled me to get a basic understanding and overview on how to use the `clip-path` property.
